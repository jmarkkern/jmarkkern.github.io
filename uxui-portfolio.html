        <p>The prompt for <a href="https://designatuci.com/designathon/23">UCI's Design-a-thon 2023</a> was about community and inclusivity, 
           so my team of 3 were inspired to design a mobile app to help users connect to other cultures through events. Our idea was to 
           encourage the community to diversify their experiences through "culture shock" by attending and participating in public occasions 
           in their area. We started by sketching out some lo-fi versions of the app on paper before digitizing and finalizing it as a

           <br><br>I worked on the interactivity and overall design of the application, as well as the conception of the idea.

        <p>This mobile app was designed based on an idea presented in class, where my group of five analyzed potential stakeholders to 
           generate software goals, requirements, and the application's architectural and interface design. As the system is centered around 
           children, we opted for a mobile app design since every parent has a phone, and many children have access to a mobile device. We 
           went into detail of the process on a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dBhb1cG5nuf0pqDGeYkJcsIf6sR61BN4/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">final class report</a> 
           and built an interactive version as a <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/UOw182LeP7nCMVAvMqyR9C/INF-121---Interface-Design?type=design&node-id=34-3&t=DRGqNej6Y6tI21Z6-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=34%3A3&mode=design" target="_blank">wireframe on Figma</a>.
           <br><br>I helped the team analyze and engineer the software application. Mainly, I focused on the design of the app's interface 
           on Figma.

        <p>As a team of 4, we designed a prototype for an endorsement system for Minecraft. As gamers ourselves, we knew the pain of trying 
           to relax and play games and instead facing harassment from other players. We wanted to focus on casual games, so we looked over to 
           Minecraft for its large player base. Our <a href="https://sites.google.com/uci.edu/team2b-endorsementsystem/designing-for-digital-thriving" target="_blank">case study</a> consisted of 4 weeks on user research, 2 weeks of brainstorming and prototype design, then refining 
           it over the course of 2 weeks based on user feedback.
           <br><br>I was responsible for some of the user research and analysis, including surveys and interviews. I also worked with the 
           team to design the prototype.</p>

    <h3>TicTacToe -- <small><em>C++</em></small></h3>
    <p>A playable server to client game of tic tac toe. 
      The server connects to the client by asking for its IP address. 
      It also keeps track of a player's number of wins, losses, and ties. 
      Check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/jmarkkern/ICS32_TicTacToe" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <h3>Sudoku Solver -- <small><em>AI / Python</em></small></h3>
    <p>Worked with a partner to implement AI algorithms to solve any given Sudoku board.
      The AI uses forward checking, arc consistency, and Norvig's heuristics together to solve the puzzle. 
      Check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/jmarkkern/CS171_Sudoku_Student" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <h3>Adversarial Attacks and Defenses -- <small><em>AI / Python</em></small></h3>
    <p>With a group, used iterative FGSM methods to perturb images in order to cause an object-odentifying ML model to make mistakes. 
      We also had to develop defensive methods as a way to train the ML model against such attacks.
