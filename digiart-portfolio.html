      <h3>Foreword</h3>
      <video controls>
        <source src="media/Foreword_YunDongJu.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.
      </video>
      <p>Yun Dongju's poem "Foreword" is his promise to be a good man while he is alive, since he loves his people and all things that are alive. 
        As such, I chose a cozy color palette to make a heartwarming mood to the animation. The man under the tree at the opening scene 
        represents Yun Dongju, as he states his manifesto. The drawings were made in Adobe Illustrator and animated entirely in After Effects; 
        the video was put together and finalized in Premiere Pro.

          <p>This is a short black and white based on humanity (as a first impression to aliens). I wanted to show humanity as "togetherness" so I 
            knew I wanted people to be holding hands to showcase that. The animations were made to look bouncy, which makes it seem friendlier and 
            cuter. This animation design was made with Adobe After Effects.

          <p>I created this as part of my project management course, where my group was in charge of creating designs for other groups. A group 
            called "PlantHead" commissioned us to design the logo and web design for their web app, which was supposed to help users learn more 
            about a plant by analyzing and identifying it from a picture. We were given the freedom to choose the color palette and font style. 
            I was in charge of design decisions and logo creation, so I created the brand board as a guide for my team to reference.

          <p>For another project from my project management course, a group called "Matcha" commissioned us to design the logo for their app, which 
            was supposed to help users discover unknown musical artists. I started with sketches inspired by their goals and created a preliminary 
            logo, which they asked to tweak, resulting in the finished logos and icons shown here.

          <p>During my time as Social Media Chair for TCA at UCI from May 2020 to June 2022, I had to design and post promotional material for the 
            club on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thaiclub_uci/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> (@thaiclub_uci) using Canva. I also drew 
            sticker designs of UCI's anteater mascot engaging in different aspects of Thai culture. While all the stickers were used as Discord 
            emotes and design assets in the club, the "Wai Anteater" (taking the form of Thai greeting) was also printed and sold as a physical sticker.
