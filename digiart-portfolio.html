              <h2>Foreword</h2>
              <p>An animated short inspired by "Foreword" by Yun Dongju, appreciating the living things.
              </p>
              <!-- Yun Dongju's poem 'Foreword' is his promise to be a good man while he is alive, since he loves his people and all things that are alive. 
                As such, I chose a cozy color palette to make a heartwarming mood to the animation. The man under the tree at the opening scene 
                represents Yun Dongju, as he states his manifesto. The drawings were made in Adobe Illustrator and animated entirely in After Effects; 
                the video was put together and finalized in Premiere Pro. -->

            cuter. This animation design was made with Adobe After Effects. -->

            which was supposed to help users learn more about a plant by analyzing and identifying it from a picture. We were given the freedom to 
            choose the color palette and font style. I was in charge of design decisions and logo creation, so I created the brand board as a guide 
            for my team to reference. -->

            was supposed to help users discover unknown musical artists. I started with sketches inspired by their goals and created a preliminary 
            logo, which they asked to tweak, resulting in the finished logos and icons shown here. -->

            club on Instagram (@thaiclub_uci) using Canva. I also drew sticker designs of UCI's anteater mascot engaging in different aspects of 
            Thai culture. While all the stickers were used as Discord  emotes and design assets in the club, the 'Wai Anteater' (taking the form 
            of Thai greeting) was also printed and sold as a physical sticker. -->
