    <h3>Foreword</h3>
    <video controls>
      <source src="media/Foreword_YunDongJu.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
    <p>Yun Dongju's poem "Foreword" is his promise to be a good man while he is alive, since he loves his people and all things that are alive. 
       As such, I chose a cozy color palette to make a heartwarming mood to the animation. The man under the tree at the opening scene 
       represents Yun Dongju, as he states his manifesto. The drawings were made in Adobe Illustrator and animated entirely in After Effects; 
       the video was put together and finalized in Premiere Pro.

    <h3><br>Unnatural Disasters</h3>
    <img src="media/unnatural_disasters.jpg" alt="A trio of images showing natural disasters caused by animated characters.">
    <p>I combined pictures of natural disasters in the real world with character from some of my favorite animations, such that the characters 
       had caused destruction to our world. I tried to make the animated characters look more natural by choosing places and character designs 
       with similar color palettes and adding shadows where I though were appropriate. The collection is under the guise of the saying "pics or 
       it didn't happen", in which Adobe Photoshop was used to make them happen.

    <h3><br>Logo For Humanity</h3>
    <div class="row">

        <img src="media/Logo_For_Humanity.gif" alt="Human kindness.">
      </div>
      <div class="column right-project">
        <p>This is a short black and white based on humanity (as a first impression to aliens). I wanted to show humanity as "togetherness" so I 
           knew I wanted people to be holding hands to showcase that. The animations were made to look bouncy, which makes it seem friendlier and 
           cuter. This animation design was made with Adobe After Effects.

      <div class="column right-project">
        <p>During my time as Social Media Chair for TCA at UCI from May 2020 to June 2022, I had to design and post promotional material for the 
           club on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thaiclub_uci/" target="_blank">Instagram</a> (@thaiclub_uci) using Canva. I also drew 
           sticker designs of UCI's anteater mascot engaging in different aspects of Thai culture. While all the stickers were used as Discord 
           emotes and design assets in the club, the "Wai Anteater" (taking the form of Thai greeting) was also printed and sold as a physical sticker.
